#### Possible solutions

 - Keep trying the open CV tool to understand if we can get to an identification and if it can be versatile enough to fin the same patterns in other images.
   - Play with the parameters to find optimal results.
   - infer rectangles missing from pattern found with the Hugh transform algorithm.
 - Match the images of the visible spectrum images with the IR ones, match pixeling, find rectangles in the visible spectrum images and find for patterns in the IR.
 - Can we automatically have the two image IR and VL?
   - It might be possible (discuss for more details)
 - Investigate how to create a cellphone app and run things from the cloud.

 - Divide the whole image in small subsections and use them to train the neural network.
   - No necessary yet
 - Could we crop images manually?
   - NO
